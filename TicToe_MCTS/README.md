# Monte Carlo Tree Search  
MCTS.py is my implementation of Monte Carlo Search Tree algorithm.  
TicTacToe.py is game environment implemented by [AlexMGitHub](https://github.com/AlexMGitHub/Checkers-MCTS)
used for verifying MCTS implementation.  
In main.py you can try out algorithm on game to see it's performance.
