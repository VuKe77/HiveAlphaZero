# HiveAlphaZero

An implementation of the **AlphaZero algorithm** adapted for the board game **Hive** and extended to chess using a Gym environment.  
This project contains a Hive environment built with `pygame`, an AlphaZero training pipeline, and supporting tools for training, evaluation, and visualization.
